# VRPetQuest
This intent of this project is to create a functional VR experience where the user is able to take care of a pet. This project has been brought to life
through scripts, models from the meta store, and our own hard work. Experience the challenges of taking care of a cat through PetQuest! View the "master" branch for more!
